# depend :remote, :gem, "will_paginate", ">=2.2.2"
# depend :remote, :command, "brightbox"
# 
# Gem with a source (such as github)
# depend :remote, :gem, "tmm1-amqp", ">=0.6.0", :source => "http://gems.github.com"

## Local Shared Area
# These are the list of files and directories that you want
# to share between the releases of your application on a particular
# server. It uses the same shared area as the log files.
#
# NOTE: local areas trump global areas, allowing you to have some
# servers using local assets if required.
#
# So if you have an 'upload' directory in public, add 'public/upload'
# to the :local_shared_dirs array.
# If you want to share the database.yml add 'config/database.yml'
# to the :local_shared_files array.
#
# The shared area is prepared with 'deploy:setup' and all the shared
# items are symlinked in when the code is updated.
# set :local_shared_dirs, %w(public/upload)
# set :local_shared_files, %w(config/database.yml)

## Global Shared Area
# These are the list of files and directories that you want
# to share between all releases of your application across all servers.
# For it to work you need a directory on a network file server shared
# between all your servers. Specify the path to the root of that area
# in :global_shared_path. Defaults to the same value as :shared_path.
# set :global_shared_path, "/srv/share/myapp"
#
# NOTE: local areas trump global areas, allowing you to have some
# servers using local assets if required.
#
# Beyond that it is the same as the local shared area.
# So if you have an 'upload' directory in public, add 'public/upload'
# to the :global_shared_dirs array.
# If you want to share the database.yml add 'config/database.yml'
# to the :global_shared_files array.
#
# The shared area is prepared with 'deploy:setup' and all the shared
# items are symlinked in when the code is updated.
# set :global_shared_dirs, %w(public/upload)
set :global_shared_files, %w(config/database.yml)
set :global_shared_files, %w(config/backup.rb)

# SSL Certificates. If you specify an SSL certificate name then
# the gem will create an 'https' configuration for this application
# TODO: Upload and install the keys on the server
# set :ssl_certificate, "/path/to/certificate/for/my_app.crt"
# set :ssl_key, "/path/to/key/for/my_app.key
# or
# set :ssl_certificate, "name_of_installed_certificate"

## Static asset caching.
# By default static assets served directly by the web server are
# cached by the client web browser for 10 years, and cache invalidation
# of static assets is handled by the Rails helpers using asset
# timestamping.
# You may need to adjust this value if you have hard coded static
# assets, or other special cache requirements. The value is in seconds.
# set :max_age, 315360000

# SSH options. The forward agent option is used so that loopback logins
# with keys work properly
ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true

# Forces a Pty so that svn+ssh repository access will work. You
# don't need this if you are using a different SCM system. Note that
# ptys stop shell startup scripts from running.
default_run_options[:pty] = true

## Logrotation
# Where the logs are stored. Defaults to <shared_path>/log
# set :log_dir, "central/log/path"
# The size at which to rotate a log. e.g 1G, 100M, 5M. Defaults to 100M
# set :log_max_size, "100M"
# How many old compressed logs to keep. Defaults to 10
# set :log_keep, "10"

## Version Control System
# Which version control system. Defaults to subversion if there is
# no 'set :scm' command.
# set :scm, :git
# set :scm_username, "rails"
# set :scm_password, "mysecret"
# or be explicit
# set :scm, :subversion

## Deployment settings
# The brightbox gem deploys as the user 'rails' by default and
# into the 'production' environment. You can change these as required.
# set :user, "rails"
# set :rails_env, :production

## Command running settings
# use_sudo is switched off by default so that commands are run
# directly as 'user' by the run command. If you switch on sudo
# make sure you set the :runner variable - which is the user the
# capistrano default tasks use to execute commands.
# NB. This just affects the default recipes unless you use the
# 'try_sudo' command to run your commands.
# set :use_sudo, false
# set :runner, user## Passenger Configuration
# Set the method of restarting passenger
# Defaults to :hard which is used to instantly free up database connections
# :soft uses the standard touch tmp/restart.txt which leaves database connections
# lingering until the workers time out
# set :passenger_restart_strategy, :hard
